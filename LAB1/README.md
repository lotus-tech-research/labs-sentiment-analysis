# Lab 1 — Sentiment Classification on a Toy Dataset

This introductory lab demonstrates the full sentiment‑classification pipeline using a small, hard‑coded toy dataset. It establishes the core workflow used in later labs.

## Features
- Toy dataset embedded directly in the notebook
- Train/test split
- TF‑IDF vectorization
- Logistic Regression classifier
- Accuracy + classification report
- Interactive menu to test custom sentences

## Purpose
Lab 1 introduces:
- Basic text preprocessing
- Vectorization with TF‑IDF
- Training a simple classifier
- Evaluating model performance
- Running inference on user‑entered text

This lab forms the foundation for Lab 2 (real dataset) and later labs on harassment detection and hybrid models.

## How to Run
Open the notebook in Google Colab and run all cells.
